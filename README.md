# Functional Profiling

Functional profiling of microbiome sequencing data using **HUMAnN3** and **eggNOG** to characterize microbial metabolic pathways and gene functions.

## 📌 Overview
This repository provides multiple approaches for analyzing the functional potential of microbial communities from sequencing data. The pipeline focuses on identifying metabolic pathways, gene families, and functional categories to better understand microbial activity and functional diversity.

## 🧬 Methods
- **HUMAnN3**  
  Quantification of microbial pathways and gene families from metagenomic or metatranscriptomic data.

- **eggNOG-mapper**  
  Functional annotation and orthology assignment for predicted genes, including COG and functional category classification.

## 🔍 Functional Analysis Approaches
- Pathway abundance and coverage analysis
- Gene family profiling
- Functional category classification (e.g., COG, KEGG-related functions)
- Comparative functional analysis across samples or conditions

## 📊 Output
- Pathway abundance tables
- Gene family profiles
- Functional annotation results
